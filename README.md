High school thesis project.

This project was intended to be a close replica of the old game Dangerous Dave,
which was one of the first PC games I've played.
The goal was to avoid the use of a game engine, in order to increase
the challenge and involve a more intensive Java coding.

While I'm keeping the original code I wrote at the time in a dedicated branch,
I'm currently maintaining the project in my free time: I have implemented the
missing parts (i.e., climbing, level-level transition, score menu, etc...),
and I plan to improve the code structure and gradually fix possible bugs.

Although my intention was just to build a mirror-like replica, at the time
I did add some new tiles (and a try of the freakin' "Level 6 Warpzone"),
and eventually I could decide to add some more stuff.

The levels are loaded from the file "gamedata.dat", that must be in the same directory
of the game launcher; the levels structure can be customized using the
